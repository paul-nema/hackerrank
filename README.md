# hackerrank

It’s been a bit since I've seriously coded C++.  Decided to refresh my skills in order to get back into the industry.  Happened across hanckerrank.com and decided this is a vehicle to achieve that objective.  Originally, I started with LeetCode but I’ve found HackerRank provides a better learning experience especially the discussion area where you see other REALLY efficient solutions.  I learn a lot by seeing different solutions, the discussions surrounding them, their O(n), etc.
